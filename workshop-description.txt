[SP] Against All Odds - Single player

Play as a NATO forces marksman at a small outpost. You are outnumbered 10-1. Defend your position at all costs. Defeat all ~150 enemies and win. You and your side WILL DIE (over and over and over)!

Features a fully populated outpost including soldiers, officers, vehicles, accommodations and more. Several waves of hostiles are ready to attack from different sides.

You are not in command of any forces, but you are a member of a squad. Just load it up, and wait for the action! Kill as many of the enemy as you can!

This scenario is a successor to my first scenario, [SP] Battle of Kamdesh / COP Keating (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=582857619)
